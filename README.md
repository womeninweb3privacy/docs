# Women in web3 Privacy 

## A Space for Connection, Exploration, and Growth

The cypherpunk movement ‚Äî like any punk movement ‚Äî is about defiance. It‚Äôs about unapologetically claiming your space, challenging systems that would prefer you stay silent, and rewriting the rules.

In privacy and web3, we‚Äôre doing exactly that: not just existing, but thriving, building, and consciously reshaping the landscape. This project isn‚Äôt about meeting quotas or ‚Äúfixing‚Äù the industry; it‚Äôs about creating a **safe, open, and inclusive space** for women and non cis men to connect, share, and grow.

Privacy is personal‚Äîit‚Äôs the foundation of our digital ‚Äúhomes.‚Äù It‚Äôs where we feel safe, empowered, and free to be ourselves. But protecting that home takes effort, knowledge, and, most importantly, a community.

That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre creating this space: a metaphorical table where we can gather, exchange ideas, and validate each other. Ever had your friend come up to you asking if she should do this talk because she is not the most knowledgeable person out there? And you cheer her on with ‚ÄúHell yeah, you deserve to be there!‚Äù? Not like this is from a real women in web3 privacy chat scenario, not at all.

## What's at our table? 

Our table is a community table. Scratch the menu: everyone brings something to share, and everyone takes what they need. 
Just like a balanced meal, we offer a mix of essentials, indulgencies and a little spice on the side.
